## Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict median house values based on various housing features. It includes:

- Data preprocessing with missing value imputation and feature scaling
- Categorical feature encoding
- Model training with multiple algorithms
- Cross-validation for model evaluation
- Trained model persistence using joblib

## Dataset

The project uses the California Housing Dataset containing:

- **8 numerical features**: Latitude, Longitude, Housing Median Age, Total Rooms, Total Bedrooms, Population, Households, Median Income
- **1 categorical feature**: Ocean Proximity
- **Target variable**: Median House Value

**Data points**: ~20,640 housing records

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/housing-price-prediction.git
cd housing-price-prediction
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model

Run the main script to train the model:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the housing dataset
- Create a stratified train-test split based on income categories
- Build and fit a RandomForestRegressor model
- Save the trained model and preprocessing pipeline to disk

### Making Predictions

Once the model is trained, run the script again with test data (`input.csv`):

```bash
python main.py
```

The predictions will be saved to `output.csv`

## Models

The project implements and compares multiple regression models:

1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline model for linear relationships
2. **Decision Tree Regressor** - Captures non-linear patterns
3. **Random Forest Regressor** - Ensemble method with improved generalization (primary model)

### Model Evaluation

Models are evaluated using cross-validation with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the metric.

## Results

The models achieve the following approximate RMSE scores (via 10-fold cross-validation):
- Linear Regression: ~73,500
- Decision Tree: ~72,000
- Random Forest: ~71,000

*Note: Train actual models to get exact results*

## Requirements
